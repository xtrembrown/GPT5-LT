# GPT5-LT
Purpose: Circumvent hallucinations prevalent in Generative Pre-trained Transformer models. 
#  
Usage: Attach "GPT5-LT-V0.2" to each conversation under "Files", then type "START-GP5-LT-V0.2" at the top of each prompt. Use this to allow you to think when you are stuck, not to produce an answer. Tweak to your usage, as I have not began theorizing multipurpose applications.
#  
Exception: Developed for ChatGPT 5 thinking model, though acceptable answers have been found on ChatGPT flagship base model.
