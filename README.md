# GPT5-LT
Purpose: Circumvent hallucinations (producing false, misleading, or nonsensical information as if it were factual or true) prevalent in Generative Pre-trained Transformer models. 
#  
Usage: Attach "GPT5-LT-V0.2.docx" to each conversation under "Files", then type "START-GP5-LT-V0.2" at the top of each prompt. Use this to allow you to think when you are stuck, not to produce an answer. Tweak to your usage, as I have not began theorizing multipurpose applications.

Exception: Developed for ChatGPT 5 thinking model, though acceptable answers have been found on ChatGPT's flagship free model.  

Note: This is not genuine code, though a rejog of the programming languages I've once used. Oddly enough it appears to worsen the model, rather than benefit the outcome, future models will be adjusted. As of 09/17/2024 I've deemed this model to be poor, due to removal of other items from the version V0.1. Will need adjusted, though this works great, because when I provide new information, from the base outline, it actually allows me to see where it's weak.
